The vulnerability exists because the affected software performs incomplete input validation of option 82 information that it receives in DHCP Version 4 (DHCPv4) packets from DHCP relay agents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv4 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap overflow condition on the affected device, which will cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.

Users are only vulnerable if they do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance. For versions prior to 1.9.0, by default, Ratpack utilizes an inferring version of `PublicAddress` which is vulnerable. This can be used to perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker can force a cached redirect to redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location.

CVE-2024-44959,tracefs: Use generic inode RCU for synchronizing freeing,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracefs: Use generic inode RCU for synchronizing freeing

With structure layout randomization enabled for 'struct inode' we need to
avoid overlapping any of the RCU-used / initialized-only-once members,
e.g. i_lru or i_sb_list to not corrupt related list traversals when making
use of the rcu_head.

For an unlucky structure layout of 'struct inode' we may end up with the
following splat when running the ftrace selftests:

[<...>] list_del corruption, ffff888103ee2cb0->next (tracefs_inode_cache+0x0/0x4e0 [slab object]) is NULL (prev is tracefs_inode_cache+0x78/0x4e0 [slab object])

Additionally, Joplin's main window is created with `nodeIntegration` set to `true`, allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution to result in arbitrary code execution.

and add check wheather extree is locked in hfsplus_free_extents().

However, when operations such as hfsplus_file_release,
hfsplus_setattr, hfsplus_unlink, and hfsplus_get_block are executed
concurrently in different files, it is very likely to trigger the
WARN_ON, which will lead syzbot and xfstest to consider it as an
abnormality.

The comment above this warning also describes one of the easy
triggering situations, which can easily trigger and cause
xfstest&syzbot to report errors.

i3c: dw: Fix use-after-free in dw_i3c_master driver due to race condition

In dw_i3c_common_probe, &master->hj_work is bound with
dw_i3c_hj_work. And dw_i3c_master_irq_handler can call
dw_i3c_master_irq_handle_ibis function to start the work.

If we remove the module which will call dw_i3c_common_remove to
make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations
that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

                                     | dw_i3c_hj_work

//free master->base                  |

                                     | //use master->base

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with

CVE-2025-0905,PDF-XChange Editor JB2 File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability,"PDF-XChange Editor JB2 File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Read Information Disclosure Vulnerability. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of PDF-XChange Editor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JB2 files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
