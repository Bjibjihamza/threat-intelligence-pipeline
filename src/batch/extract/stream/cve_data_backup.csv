CVE-2025-62506,MinIO vulnerable to privilege escalation via session policy bypass in service accounts and STS,"MinIO is a high-performance object storage system. In all versions prior to RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z, a privilege escalation vulnerability allows service accounts and STS (Security Token Service) accounts with restricted session policies to bypass their inline policy restrictions when performing operations on their own account, specifically when creating new service accounts for the same user. The vulnerability exists in the IAM policy validation logic where the code incorrectly relied on the DenyOnly argument when validating session policies for restricted accounts. When a session policy is present, the system should validate that the action is allowed by the session policy, not just that it is not denied. An attacker with valid credentials for a restricted service or STS account can create a new service account for itself without policy restrictions, resulting in a new service account with full parent privileges instead of being restricted by the inline policy. This allows the attacker to access buckets and objects beyond their intended restrictions and modify, delete, or create objects outside their authorized scope. The vulnerability is fixed in version RELEASE.2025-10-15T17-29-55Z.","Oct. 16, 2025, 10:15 p.m.","Oct. 16, 2025, 10:15 p.m.",Yes !,security-advisories@github.com,Authorization,"[{""id"": ""1"", ""vendor"": ""Minio"", ""product"": ""minio""}]","[{""score"": ""8.1"", ""version"": ""CVSS 3.1"", ""severity"": ""HIGH"", ""vector"": ""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N"", ""exploitability_score"": ""2.8"", ""impact_score"": ""5.2"", ""source_identifier"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}]",https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62506
CVE-2025-62504,Envoy Lua filter use-after-free when oversized rewritten response body causes crash,"Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy. Envoy versions earlier than 1.36.2, 1.35.6, 1.34.10, and 1.33.12 contain a use-after-free vulnerability in the Lua filter. When a Lua script executing in the response phase rewrites a response body so that its size exceeds the configured per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes (default 1MB), Envoy generates a local reply whose headers override the original response headers, leaving dangling references and causing a crash. This results in denial of service. Updating to versions 1.36.2, 1.35.6, 1.34.10, or 1.33.12 fixes the issue. Increasing per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes (and for HTTP/2 the initial_stream_window_size) or increasing per_request_buffer_limit_bytes / request_body_buffer_limit can reduce the likelihood of triggering the condition but does not correct the underlying memory safety flaw.","Oct. 16, 2025, 10:15 p.m.","Oct. 16, 2025, 10:15 p.m.",Yes !,security-advisories@github.com,Memory Corruption,"[{""id"": ""1"", ""vendor"": ""Envoyproxy"", ""product"": ""envoy""}]","[{""score"": ""6.5"", ""version"": ""CVSS 3.1"", ""severity"": ""MEDIUM"", ""vector"": ""CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"", ""exploitability_score"": ""2.8"", ""impact_score"": ""3.6"", ""source_identifier"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}]",https://cvefeed.io/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-62504
